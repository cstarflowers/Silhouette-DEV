Silhouette is a rhythm-based RPG game, following our main character and the escapist world of music inside their mind. As the result of neglect, hatred, and isolation, they often find themselves in the world of their dreams, alongside their highest hopes and worst nightmares. Help our main character complete this musical journey through their mind by uncovering the truth and coming to realize what it truly means to set yourself free. Their fate lies in your hands.
